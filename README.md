# speng-chaos

A tool for turning SE's universe into a bunch of hot dogs

## Major Warning

This WILL crash SE. No exceptions. But more importantly, if you're prone to seizures from flashing lights, DO NOT USE THIS. It's pretty bad. I may add a setting to disable any patches that are particularly flashy but no guarantees since I may never come back to this project in the future.

## Installation

### From Github

Download the latest release in the Releases tab on the right of the screen and unzip the archive somewhere. Note that the destination cannot contain any spaces! This is an issue with SE that I cannot fix.

### From Workshop

Subscribe to the addon and navigate to Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/314650/2906166279 and move the "SpaceEngine Chaos Edition" folder somewhere else. Like stated before, the destination cannot contain any spaces!
