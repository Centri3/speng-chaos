A tool for turning SE's universe into a bunch of hot dogs

## Major Warning

This WILL crash SE. No exceptions. But more importantly, if you're prone to seizures from flashing lights, DO NOT USE THIS. It's pretty bad. I may add a setting to disable any patches that are particularly flashy but no guarantees since I may never come back to this project in the future.
